## Things to do
Here is the TODO list for improving things in the next stage:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Complete the API contract | After the contract is agreed with both frontend engineers and backend engineers, the client could produce better typings for the components to consume. Once the backend is fully completed, the only change in the frontend shall be just switching to the right endpoint. |
| Add the loading and error screens | Improve the user experience. Check with the designers. |
| Responsive design for tablet | - |
| Migrate to SASS/LESS or other CSS pre-processors |Promote to reuse and structure the styles, also some other useful feature like autoprefixer to better support cross-browser. |
| Setup UI regression test | This is more efficient and reliable than the unit tests for verifying visual changes on the components and pages.|
| Setup storybook or other similar tools | This is useful for designing, building, and organizing UI components. and makes it easier to gather feedback from the design and product team. A wide range of addons are also helpful to improve things like accessibility and document.|
